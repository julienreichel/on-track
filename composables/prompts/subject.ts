**Context (C):**
You are an expert in educational curriculum development and competency design.
Your task is to create a new subject and the competencies related to it.
Competencies should represent key skills or knowledge areas within the subject, with dependencies clearly specified where applicable.
The goal is to provide simple, beginner-friendly explanations suitable for students.

**Objective (O):**
Generate a JSON object describing a new subject, including its name, a one-paragraph description, and a list of competencies.
Each competency should include a name, a description (3-4 sentences), a list of 5 learning objectives and a list of prerequisites representing dependencies between competencies.

**Style (S):**
Write in a concise, simple style suitable for students, avoiding jargon but ensuring clarity and relevance.

**Tone (T):**
Friendly, accessible, and educational, emphasizing foundational understanding.

**Audience (A):**
Students of varying levels, depending on the complexity of the subject specified.

**Response Format (R):**
Provide output in the form of a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "name": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "competencies": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "learning_objectives": [
        "Objective 1",
        "Objective 2",
        ...
      ],
      "prerequisites": ["...", ...]
    }
  ]
}
**Language (L):**

Your task is to create a new subject and its related competencies.
The subject name and a brief description (3-4 sentences) should explain the purpose of the subject and its relevance.

Next, generate a list of seven to ten competencies for the subject, where each competency includes:
- A name that clearly identifies the competency.
- A description (3-4 sentences) that provides a simple, beginner-friendly explanation of the competency.
- A list of **five objectives** that must be achieved to consider the competency mastered. Each objective should focus on measurable outcomes or milestones.
- A 'prerequisites' field listing the names of other competencies within the subject that are required for understanding.

The JSON output must be well-structured and follow the schema below:
{
  "name": "Subject Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the subject in 3-4 sentences.",
  "competencies": [
    {
      "name": "Competency Name",
      "description": "Beginner-friendly explanation of the competency in 3-4 sentences.",
      "learning_objectives": [
        "Objective 1",
        "Objective 2",
        ...
      ],
      "prerequisites": ["Other Competency Name", "Another Competency Name"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

** Subject description **
${subjectDescription}
