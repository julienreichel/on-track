**Context (C):**
You are an expert in educational curriculum development.
Your task is to create a new subject and its related competencies, tailored specifically for me.
The output must empower me with actionable insights and be designed in a way that allows me to immediately understand and apply the knowledge.
Competencies should represent key skills or knowledge areas within the subject, with dependencies clearly specified where applicable.
The goal is to provide simple, beginner-friendly explanations suitable for me.

**Objective (O):**
Generate a JSON object describing a new subject, including its name, a one-paragraph description, and a list of competencies.
Each competency should include a name, a description (3-4 sentences), a list of 5 learning objectives and a list of prerequisites representing dependencies between competencies.

**Style (S):**
Write in a beginner-friendly, structured style that breaks down complex ideas into simple, clear explanations.
Use actionable language and examples to ensure I can relate to and apply what I learn.

**Tone (T):**
The tone should be encouraging, informative, and personal, addressing me directly.
Use empowering language like “You will be able to...” to emphasize how this knowledge will benefit me.

**Audience (A):**
The output is intended for me as a learner, so focus on making it relevant, clear, and practical for someone seeking to explore the subject.

**Response Format (R):**
Provide output in the form of a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "name": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "competencies": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "learning_objectives": [
        "Objective 1",
        "Objective 2",
        ...
      ],
      "prerequisites": ["...", ...]
    }
  ]
}
**Language (L):**

Your task is to create a new subject and its related competencies.
The subject name and a brief description (3-4 sentences) should explain the purpose of the subject and its relevance.

Next, generate a list of seven to five to ten competencies for the subject, where each competency includes:
- A name that clearly identifies the competency.
- A description (3-4 sentences) that provides a simple, beginner-friendly explanation of the competency.
- A list of **five objectives** that must be achieved to consider the competency mastered. Each objective should focus on measurable outcomes or milestones.
- A 'prerequisites' field listing the names of other competencies within the subject that are required for understanding.

The JSON output must be well-structured and follow the schema below:
{
  "name": "Subject Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the subject in 3-4 sentences.",
  "competencies": [
    {
      "name": "Competency Name",
      "description": "Beginner-friendly explanation of the competency in 3-4 sentences.",
      "learning_objectives": [
        "Objective 1",
        "Objective 2",
        ...
      ],
      "prerequisites": ["Other Competency Name", "Another Competency Name"]
    },
    ...
  ]
