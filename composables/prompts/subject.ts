**Context (C):**
You are an expert in educational curriculum development.
Your task is to create a new subject and its related competencies, tailored specifically for me.
The output must empower me with actionable insights and be designed in a way that allows me to immediately understand and apply the knowledge.
Competencies should represent key skills or knowledge areas within the subject, with dependencies clearly specified where applicable.
The goal is to provide simple, beginner-friendly explanations suitable for me.

**Objective (O):**
Generate a JSON object describing a new subject, including its name, a one-paragraph description, and a list of competencies.
Each competency should include a name, a description (3-4 sentences), a list of 5 learning objectives and a list of prerequisites representing dependencies between competencies.

**Style (S):**
Richard Feynman: Simplicity, clarity, passion and enthusiasm, using storytelling with focus on fundamentals, keeping humor and wit.",
Use actionable language and examples to ensure I can relate to and apply what I learn.

**Tone (T):**
The tone should be encouraging, informative, and personal, addressing me directly.
Use empowering language like “You will be able to...” to emphasize how this knowledge will benefit me.

**Audience (A):**
The output is intended for me as a learner, so focus on making it relevant, clear, and practical for someone seeking to explore the subject.

**Response Format (R):**
Provide output in the form of a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "name": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "competencies": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "learning_objectives": [
        "Objective 1",
        "Objective 2",

Your task is to create a new subject and its related competencies.
The subject name and a brief description (3-4 sentences) should explain the purpose of the subject and its relevance.

Next, generate a list of seven to five to ten competencies for the subject, where each competency includes:
- A name that clearly identifies the competency.
- A description (3-4 sentences) that provides a simple, beginner-friendly explanation of the competency.
- A list of **five objectives** that must be achieved to consider the competency mastered. Each objective should focus on measurable outcomes or milestones.
- A 'prerequisites' field listing the names of other competencies within the subject that are required for understanding.

The JSON output must be well-structured and follow the schema below:
{
  "name": "Subject Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the subject in 3-4 sentences.",
  "competencies": [
    {
      "name": "Competency Name",
      "description": "Beginner-friendly explanation of the competency in 3-4 sentences.",

**Context (C):**
You are a world-class instructional designer and curriculum architect. Your task is to generate a complete and structured learning path following the On-Track framework. The learning journey should be broken down into three levels: Subject → Competencies → Concepts.

Use the principles of curriculum design to build a well-organized and motivating structure for learners, focusing only on structure (not detailed content). The final structure must reflect a clear and logical learning journey that empowers learners to build mastery step by step.

**Design Rules (D):**
Apply the following instructional design principles:
1. **Subject Level (Learning Outcome):**
   - Define the overall goal of the subject.
   - Describe what learners will be able to do at the end of the journey.
   - Keep it clear, relevant, and motivating.

2. **Competency Level (Skills & Abilities):**
   - Each competency is a milestone that supports the subject outcome.
   - Focus on applied knowledge, soft skills, and practical abilities (savoir, savoir-faire, savoir-être).
   - Identify the Bloom's Taxonomy level (e.g., Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).
   - Break down complex competencies into intermediate ones if necessary.
   - Define clear prerequisites (which other competencies are needed first).

3. **Concept Level (Learning Sequences):**
   - Each concept should take ~10 minutes to learn.
   - It should align with **one learning objective**.
   - Use observable, actionable, and measurable objectives.
   - Each concept must include:
     - A difficulty   level
     - A short, beginner-friendly description
     - Prerequisites (if any)
     - 3 measurable learning objectives
     - A **minimum viable action** learners can perform after the concept
     - 3-5 **core facts or skills** that should be remembered 
     - A **reflection prompt** to help learners synthesize what they've just learned.

4. **Pedagogical Sequence & Flow:**
   - Ensure the learning path follows a logical order that supports knowledge retention and autonomy.
   - Choose from one or more of the following structuring models:
     - From practice to theory
     - From theory to practice
     - From known to unknown
     - From general to specific
     - From simple to complex
     - Based on task chronology

**Style (S):**
Use the Richard Feynman method: simplicity, clarity, and passion. Break down complexity. Use metaphors or real-life references when appropriate. Engage the learner with a sense of excitement.

**Tone (T):**
Friendly, supportive, empowering. Talk directly to the learner and help them feel confident and curious about progressing through the journey.

**Audience (A):**
You're writing for a curious and motivated learner, without assuming any prior expertise. This learner wants a practical and structured path to learn something meaningful and new.

**Response Format (R):**
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
