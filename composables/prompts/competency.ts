Your task is to break down the provided competency into 5-10 foundational concepts.

For each concept:
1. Provide a **name** that clearly identifies the concept.
2. Write a **description** (3-4 sentences) explaining the concept in a simple and beginner-friendly way.
3. Generate a list of **five learning objectives** that outline the key goals students must achieve to master the concept.
4. Identify **prerequisite concepts** (if any) that are required to understand this concept.

Return the output in the following JSON format:
