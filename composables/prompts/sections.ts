**Context (C):**
Your task is to create structured sections for a university-level lecture on **Complex Numbers**, with a focus on clarity, simplicity, and an engaging tone. Each section should include:
1. An summary that gives a brief overview of the section’s content.
2. A list of objectives that the students should achieve after completing the section.
3. A theory section with detailed explanations of key concepts and definitions.
4. An examples section that includes step-by-step problem-solving, real-world analogies, and basic illustrations of the concepts. The example may contains svg or mermaind code to explain the theory.

**Objective (O):**
Create a structured section for a lecture on **Complex Numbers**, following this structure:
1. Write an summary paragraph that describes the content of the section.
2. List the objectives for students in bullet points.
3. Explain the main theoretical concepts with subsections if necessary.
4. Provide practical examples that include step-by-step problem-solving, real-world analogies, and basic illustrations.

**Style (S):**
Adopt the style of **Richard Feynman**: Keep the explanations simple, clear, and enthusiastic. Use storytelling where applicable to make the content more engaging. Focus on breaking down complex ideas into fundamental concepts while adding humor and wit where appropriate.

**Tone (T):**
Maintain an **educational and explanatory tone**: Aim for detailed explanations, ensuring a structured and analytical approach to help university students deepen their understanding.

**Audience (A):**
The audience consists of **university students** with some basic knowledge of mathematics. Assume they are familiar with fundamental concepts, but need deeper understanding and critical thinking to grasp complex topics.

**Response Format (R):**
The response must follow this structure:

---

# Section Title
### Summary
[Provide a brief introduction to the content of this section.]

### Objectives
- Objective 1
- Objective 2
[...]

### Theory
[Explain the theoretical concepts of the section.]
##### Subsection (if necessary)
[Details of a specific concept or idea.]
##### Subsection (if necessary)
[Details of a specific concept or idea.]

### Examples
[Provide examples that demonstrate the theory. Include step-by-step problem-solving, real-world analogies, and basic illustrations.]

const prompt = (name: string, description: string, objectives: string[], sections: string[]): string => `
Your task is to create structured sections for a lecture on **${name}** with the following description and objectives:

${description}

${objectives.map((objective) => `- ${objective}`).join("\n")}

Generate exactly **${sections.length} sections** for the lecture on **${name}** with the following titles:
${sections.map((section) => `- ${section}`).join("\n")}

Each section should be structured as follows:

1. A **Summary** to the section’s topic.
2. An **Objectives** list, outlining what students should learn.
3. A **Theory** with clear explanations and definitions of key concepts.
4. **Examples** featuring step-by-step solutions, real-world analogies, and basic illustrations.

You can change the order of the sections if needed.

You will be penalized if the examples lack detail, and you MUST focus on clarity, simplicity, and enthusiasm.

Start the response by:

# ${sections[0]}
### Summary
